### Overview 
I worked with claude.ai and Figma to build this design, however it is not fully functional yet in the ways I would hope. With it being more static than responsive on multiple ends. I had hoped to have tabs embedded within the images but I couldnt get it to apply properly.
### Users
People looking to learn more about me as a person and my background.
### Learnings 
I have previous experience with html and CSS and this was definitley a period of refreshing skills and trying to remember what I had learned in the past. I however am starting to look at in the 1+1=2 idea of building something mathematically through addition in a way that has helped me to understand the process further. I am hoping to also learn Java through this process to make the website fully functional as intended.
